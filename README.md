# customer-churn-prediction

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

It contains demographic, account, and service usage information for a sample of telecom company customers. Each record includes whether or not the customer has churned, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks such as **binary classification**.

## Objectives  
The main objective of this project is:

> To develop a machine learning system that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their account and service usage data.

To achieve this, the project is broken down into the following sub-goals:

1. ðŸ“ˆ Perform in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns and distributions across features.
